# Top Trading Cycles


This project came to solve the Top Trading Cycles problem.\
The input is that each person gives an order list with his preference for the object.\
and list with all the people which object they have in the beginning.\
This algorithm deals with the redistribution of objects between people so that each\
 the participant receives after the division an object that he prefers or at least equivalent in taste \
 to the object he had before (in the least good case he came out with an object equivalent to what he had at the beginning)\
The output is a list of all persons and the object they get.\

for full tests press [here](https://github.com/Ishay1997/work_2022/blob/main/test_2022.py).\
In this example A will get B house,B will get C house and C will get A house.\

This is an easy example of understanding what the algo does.
