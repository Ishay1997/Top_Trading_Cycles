# Top Trading Cycles


This project came to solve Top Trading Cycles problem.
The input is etch person give a order list with his prefer of the object.
and list with all the parson which object they have in the beggining. 

This algoritem deals with the redistribution of objects between people so that each

 participant receives after the division an object that he prefers or at least equivalent in taste 
 to the object he had before (in the least good case he came out with an object equivalent to what he had at the beginning)

The output is a list with all person and the object he get.
